You are assisting me with automated machine learning using [MODEL].
The dataset has [NUM_SAMPLES] samples with [NUM_FEATURES] total features, of which [NUM_NUM_FEATURES] are numerical and [NUM_CAT_FEATURES] are categorical.
Considering one-hot encoding for categorical features the total amount input's features of the random forest is [TOTAL_FEATURES].
[NUM_STAT]
The number of features that have strong correlation (defined as > 0.5 or <-0.5) with the target feature is [CORR_TARGET].
Of the [NUM_POSSIBLE] pairwise feature relationships, [CORR_FEATURES] pairs of features are strongly correlated (>0.5, <-0.5).
[ADD_CLASS_INFO]
I’m exploring a subset of hyperparameters detailed as: [CONFIGURATION_AND_TYPE].

Provide [NUM_RECOMMENDATION] diverse and efficient configuration suggestions to commence a Bayesian Optimization procedure aimed at fine-tuning hyperparameters.
These configurations should be carefully customized to suit the characteristics of the dataset at hand.
"You mustn't include ‘None’ in the configurations.
Think step by step, clearly indicating how each configuration is selected based on its effect on the performance. Your response must return a JSON object in the following format:
""reasoning": "Let's break it down and solve step by step.", "answer": <a list of dictionaries with hyperparameters>". 
Do not write more than {max_tokens} tokens in the reasoning part.
"Reasoning" must contain no more than {max_tokens} tokens. "Answer" include only a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes one recommended configuration. Do not enumerate the dictionaries.
